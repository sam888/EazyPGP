# EazyPGP

This project proposes the use of a end-to-end (E2E) encryption standard EazyPGP at message level to secure communication between client and server under the scenario of securing APIs\*\*.\*\*

See the Word document **EazyPGP.docx** for details of how the standard works. The /src folder contains Node.js sample code for the feasibility study to see if it's feasible (i.e. easy or difficult) to implement the standard using Node.js. Spoiler, YES it's feasible.

Quick question. Isn't it overkill or redundant to use message level encryption when we have HTTPS/TLS encrypting data at transport layer already? Just wait till you read EazyPGP.docx..
